/*
 Definitions:
 From Prolog / First order logic
 - Term: The basic building block we use. Same as a Prolog term
    - has a name and zero or more arguments, which can themselves be terms.
 - Constant: A statement about something true in the world
    - Is a single term
 - Axiom: Declares that things are logically equivalent
    - has a head and a set of Terms.  The head and the Terms are equivalent
 - Variable: Used when running queries. Replace a term argument with a variable to ask a question of a set of Axioms and Constants
 - Ground Term: if a Term has no variables, it is considered "Ground"

 From Heirarchical Task Networks
 - Task: Declares that something needs to be *done*. It can be Primitive: it can be done simply by modifying state in the world with no further processing, or Compound: It must be further refined in order to be accomplished in the state
    - Has a Name, and a set of Terms
 - Operator: Describes how to accomplish a Primitive Task.
    - Has a Head which is a Primitive Task, a list of State to delete, and a list of State to Add. When executed, it changes the state of the world via its adds and deletes.
    - The Head of an operator uniquely defines the operator.  You can't have multiple operators with the same name
    - In order for a Task to match an operator, all the terms resulting from the unification of the two must be ground
 - Method: Describes how to refine a Compound Task.
    - has a Head which is a Compound Task, a Condition which must be true for it to work, and a list of Tasks (either Primitive or Compound) which, once refined or executed, will accomplish that Task
 - State: The collection of Constants and Axioms that are true about the world. Sometimes called Program in my code since Prolog uses that term
 - Domain: The collection of Methods and Operators used for the planning problem
 - Tasks: The collection of Tasks which need to be accomplished for the planning problem. Sometimes called goals
 - Planning Problem: A triple of State, Domain and Tasks which defines the entire planning problem
 - Plan: The final output of the algorithm is a Plan, which is a list of Operators which, once executed, solve the goals. Specifically, it is a list of the Heads of the Operators (since that uniquely defines them)

 Assumptions:
 - Operators and Methods cannot share names.  Operators name will always shadow a Method name

 Algorithm:
    PlanList FindPlan(TaskList, State, Domain):
        - Get the first task off the list
        - If the task list is empty, this is a leaf node, return the solution that has built up
        - If the task name is an operator name and the task and operator head unify to ground it is a successful resolution.
            - Add the operators to the Plan
            - Modify the state as per the operator
            - FindPlan() the remaining task list
        - If the task name is a method name it may create multiple alternative branches to explore. Each branch represents a *different* solution
            - Find each Method head that Task can unify with
            - Take the unification result and apply it to the Method's Condition
            - Finally, Resolve the Condition: i.e. apply axioms to the Condition until it is "resolved" to a set of Constants (rules that are true about the world)
                - Because Axioms can contain variables, it is possible that there is more than one resolution
                - If there are > 0 resolutions, it is a successful resolution and ALL resolutions are returned. Each resolution represents a *different* solution
            - Go through each method/Resolution pair that got generated
                - Apply any unifications from the head and the resolution to the task list for the method
                - Add these tasks to the *beginning* of the task list
                - FindPlan() the new task list
        - If the task doesn't bind with anything return FAIL
 
        NOTE: Based on the above, there are two ways you can get multiple solutions back: if there are multiple methods that bind to a task and if a method condition returns multiple answers when resolved

This implementation has extensions that behave differently.  Certain types of nodes don't do the default behavior of simply searching the tree and returning:
- Arithmetic rules simply resolve immediately
- try() simply ignores failure in the do() clause which could be modelled as a special kind of node that returns success even if it fails
- AnyOf and AllOf modify how a Method handles method resolution. Instead of treating resolutions as separate solutions, they treat them as a single solution.
    - AllOf simply adds all resolutions as additional tasks and thus fails if any fails
    - AnyOf succeeds as long as one succeeds
- else Methods are only run if the rule before it fails.  There can be multiple else clauses.
